This repo is to provide a mirror of source tarballs of third-party tools needed for development builds of Xapian.  CI uses this mirror as it means we're less likely to fail to fetach these tarballs, and it avoids repeatedly fetching from the original download host.

You don't need this repo to build release tarballs.

For the licenses of these tools, see the source code of the tools themselves.
